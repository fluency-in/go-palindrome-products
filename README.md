# Go: Palindrome Products

Write a program that can detect palindrome products in a given range.

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.

The tests are written using the `testing` package in the standard library.

To run a test file use the `go test` command:

    go test
